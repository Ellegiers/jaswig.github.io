      <h2>How Jaswig was born</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of friends that get our energy from brainstorming about new business ideas, discovering new places, networking with like-minded people, creating new insights and living responsibly. While we started working and had to sit still all day, we developed the personal need for a more flexible workspace. We believed to be active people, but sat down for more than 13h a day! We couldn’t find a standing desk that wasn’t too bulky, too expensive or looking like a transformer. Since we love to be challenged, we decided to re-invent the standing desk. Jaswig was born in November, 2014.
